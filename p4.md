In this project you will implement a FIFO queue as a monitor that can be used to solve the bounded buffer problem. Your queue will have a fixed capacity and will block calling threads when it is full or empty. Bounded buffers are extremely common in Operating Systems. When you write code in Java, Python, C#, etc. it may seem like you have infinite memory. However, infinite memory is just an abstraction that the OS provides, in reality you are limited by the physical hardware the OS is running on. This data structure could be used to build higher level abstractions like a [thread pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool)
